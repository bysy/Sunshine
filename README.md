Sunshine
========

My clone of the [Sunshine app](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine-Version-2)
used in the "Developing Android Apps" and "Advanced Android Development"
courses from Udacity.

I followed along with the lessons on a single branch instead of using Udacity's
solutions. You have to do a little extra clean-up occasionally, but on the
whole it's more satisfying because you are, in a sense, taking ownership of the
app.
